# UFOs
Use basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS along with JavaScript to build and style a webpage.
## Overview
Dana is a journalist who has been given an opportunity to write about whatever she wants, and she chooses to uses to focus on UFO sightings in her hometown. Within the module, we helped her use JavaScript to display data of UFO sightings (given to her as a Javascript file) as a table using multiple filters and create a clean HTML page to help her post her article online, along with the table of data that can be filtered to help fine-tune her results. We have created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users will be able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
Using JavaScript and HTML we have created an interactive webpage that allows the reader to filter the data around UFO sightings. As we can see in Fig.1 below, the user can search the data by filtering based on: 
- Date 
- City 
- State 
- Country
- Shape
